"""
SRE incident dashboard - a persona-specific capability for Site Reliability
Engineers (currently: Nishant), separate from the general Daily Plan since
it's a different job-shape: tracking a running incident queue, its
resolution trend, and self-improvement insights - not a ranked list of
today's priorities.

Ticket "notes" here are demo-mocked - nothing is actually written to
ServiceNow - but the response is a genuine, specific confirmation message
reflecting exactly what was asked for, not a generic toast. Assigning
incidents was deliberately left out: a real SRE would do that directly in
ServiceNow, not through a side dashboard, so recreating it here would be a
feature with no real value.
